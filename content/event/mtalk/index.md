summary: "Information Battle: Classical Vs Quantum Computers"
abstract: 'Information Battle: Classical Vs Quantum Computers <br> These days, we are all surrounded by information.  A huge computational power needs to process this information. Refer to Mooreâ€™s law, the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years so due to physical limitations computing method must be changed.  A new revolutionary method is Quantum Computing. Quantum Computers use quantum mechanics to achieve greater power than conventional computers. The classical computers just use binary codes but the quantum computers use Qubits. So, the superposition of $|0\rangle $ and $|1 \rangle $ will be used instead of binary $0$ and $1$. For example to process 1090 bits we just need 300 Qubits.  Due to implementation difficulties such as lack of technology and algorithm limitations, quantum supremacy has not been achieved yet. In this presentation, I will discuss the advances in quantum computing and try to respond to this question:  The Quantum Computers will replace Classical Computers?'

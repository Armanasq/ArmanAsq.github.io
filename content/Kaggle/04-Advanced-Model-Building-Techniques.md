# Tutorial 4: Advanced Model Building Techniques

## Introduction
Welcome to Tutorial 4 of our Kaggle series! In this tutorial, we will explore advanced model building techniques that can help you improve your performance in Kaggle competitions. We will cover various topics, including ensemble learning, hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and model stacking. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a deeper understanding of these advanced techniques and how to apply them effectively. Let's dive in!

## Step 1: Ensemble Learning
Ensemble learning involves combining multiple models to improve predictive performance. Here are a few popular ensemble techniques:

1. **Voting:** Combine predictions from multiple models by majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression).
2. **Bagging:** Train multiple models on different subsets of the training data and average their predictions.
3. **Boosting:** Train models sequentially, where each subsequent model focuses on the examples the previous models struggled with.
4. **Stacking:** Combine predictions from multiple models as input to a meta-model, which makes the final prediction.

Ensemble learning can help improve the robustness and generalization of your models by leveraging the strengths of different algorithms.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import StackingRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Create an ensemble of classifiers
clf1 = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf2 = LogisticRegression()
voting_clf = VotingClassifier(estimators=[('dt', clf1), ('lr', clf2)], voting='hard')

# Create an ensemble of bagged regressors
bagging_regressor = BaggingRegressor(base_estimator=DecisionTreeRegressor())

# Create an ensemble of boosted classifiers
boosted_clf = AdaBoostClassifier(base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier())

# Create a stacked ensemble regressor
stacked_regressor = StackingRegressor(estimators=[('dt', clf1), ('lr', clf2)], final_estimator=RandomForestRegressor())
```

## Step 2: Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameters are the settings that define how a model is trained. Tuning these hyperparameters can significantly impact model performance. Here's how you can perform hyperparameter tuning:

1. **Grid Search:** Define a grid of hyperparameter values and exhaustively search through all possible combinations.
2. **Random Search:** Define a distribution for each hyperparameter and randomly sample combinations.
3. **Bayesian Optimization:** Use Bayesian methods to efficiently search the hyperparameter space.

Hyperparameter tuning can be computationally expensive, but it's essential for finding the best configurations for your models.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Grid Search
param_grid = {'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300], 'max_depth': [None, 5, 10]}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestClassifier(), param_grid=param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Random Search
param_dist = {'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300], 'max_depth': [None, 5, 10]}
random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=RandomForestClassifier(), param_distributions=param_dist, cv=5)
random_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 3: Feature Selection
Feature selection is the process of selecting the most relevant features for model training. It helps reduce dimensionality, improve model interpretability, and avoid overfitting. Consider the following techniques:

1. **Filter Methods:**

 Use statistical tests or correlation analysis to rank features based on their relevance.
2. **Wrapper Methods:** Train models with different subsets of features and select the best subset based on model performance.
3. **Embedded Methods:** Select features as part of the model training process (e.g., L1 regularization).

Feature selection can be performed before or during model training, depending on the approach used.

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFECV
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Filter Methods - SelectKBest
selector = SelectKBest(k=10)
X_train_selected = selector.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)

# Wrapper Methods - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
estimator = LogisticRegression()
rfe = RFECV(estimator=estimator, step=1, cv=5)
X_train_selected = rfe.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)

# Embedded Methods - L1 Regularization
estimator = LogisticRegression(penalty='l1', solver='liblinear')
estimator.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Step 4: Model Stacking
Model stacking is a powerful technique where predictions from multiple models are used as input to a meta-model, which then makes the final prediction. Here's how you can implement model stacking:

1. **Create a set of base models:** Train multiple diverse models on the training data.
2. **Generate predictions:** Make predictions using the base models on the validation or test data.
3. **Build a meta-model:** Use the base model predictions as input features and train a meta-model to make the final prediction.

Model stacking can capture complex relationships and improve prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of different models.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the data into training and validation sets
X_train_stack, X_val_stack, y_train_stack, y_val_stack = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.2)

# Train base models
base_model1 = RandomForestRegressor()
base_model1.fit(X_train_stack, y_train_stack)
base_model2 = LinearRegression()
base_model2.fit(X_train_stack, y_train_stack)

# Generate base model predictions on the validation set
base_model1_preds = base_model1.predict(X_val_stack)
base_model2_preds = base_model2.predict(X_val_stack)

# Build a meta-model using the base model predictions
meta_model = LinearRegression()
meta_model_input = np.column_stack((base_model1_preds, base_model2_preds))
meta_model.fit(meta_model_input, y_val_stack)
```
